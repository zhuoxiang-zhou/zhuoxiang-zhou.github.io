Welcome!

I’m currently a junior majoring in Economics at **Peking University**. I spent Fall 2024 as a visiting student at UC Berkeley and am visiting Harvard University in Spring 2025.

I work across **labor, health, and public economics**, using empirical methods to study how policies and institutions shape individual behavior and welfare. I’m also passionate about **the economics of science**, with a particular interest in how geopolitical dynamics and research incentives influence collaboration and knowledge production.

I'm always happy to connect — feel free to reach me at [zxzhou21@stu.pku.edu.cn](mailto:zxzhou21@stu.pku.edu.cn) or [zhuoxiang.zhou@gmail.com](mailto:zhuoxiang.zhou@gmail.com).

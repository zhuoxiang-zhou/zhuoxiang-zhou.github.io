Welcome!

I'm currently a junior majoring in Economics at **Peking University**. I visited UC Berkeley in Fall 2024 and am visiting Harvard University in Spring 2025.

My research interests lie in **Labor Economics, Health Economics, and the Economics of Science**. I'm passionate about using empirical tools to study how policy can shape human decisions and improve welfare.

I'm always happy to connect â€” you can reach me at [zxzhou21@stu.pku.edu.cn](mailto:zxzhou21@stu.pku.edu.cn) or [zhuoxiang.zhou@gmail.com](mailto:zhuoxiang.zhou@gmail.com).
